# ðŸ›’ Zen Guarden 

Secure plugin marketplace to extend the Safe account functionalities with audit attestations

ZenGuarden implements the `SafeProtocolManager` `SafeProtocolRegistry` from [Safe{Core} Protocol](https://github.com/5afe/safe-core-protocol). The Marketplace app is built with the template from [Safe{Core} Protocol Demo](https://github.com/5afe/safe-core-protocol-demo).

ZenGuarden also leverages the onchain attestation to both create and verify audit attestations using [https://attest.sh](https://attest.sh/).


The entire flow is deployed on Optimism as it is the common denominator for EAS and Safe Wallet but the contracts are deployed on Optimism, Base.
